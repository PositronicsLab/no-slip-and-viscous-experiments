# - Find LAPACK library
# This module finds an installed fortran library that implements the LAPACK
# linear-algebra interface (see http://www.netlib.org/lapack/).
#
# The approach follows that taken for the autoconf macro file, acx_lapack.m4
# (distributed at http://ac-archive.sourceforge.net/ac-archive/acx_lapack.html).
#
# This module sets the following variables:
#  LAPACK_FOUND - set to true if a library implementing the LAPACK interface
#    is found
#  LAPACK_LINKER_FLAGS - uncached list of required linker flags (excluding -l
#    and -L).
#  LAPACK_LIBRARIES - uncached list of libraries (using full path name) to
#    link against to use LAPACK
#  BLA_STATIC  if set on this determines what kind of linkage we do (static)
#  BLA_VENDOR  if set checks only the specified vendor, if not set checks
#     all the possibilities
### List of vendors (BLA_VENDOR) valid in this module
##  Intel(mkl), ACML,Apple, NAS, Generic
