Q: When is it appropriate to pass a pose to a function and when is it 
better to pass a *pointer* to a pose?

A: The two have different semantics. Functions for objects that define their 
   own pose, like a rigid body, should take a pose, rather than a pointer.
   The former means that you can change the current pose, but you cannot
   _own_ it (the difference is that if you pass in a pointer to a pose, that
   pose can change at any time). The latter restricts the ways that pose can
   be changed (e.g., only through a set_pose() method), _in particular if the
   function validates that the passed pose's is set relative to some other
   desired pose).
