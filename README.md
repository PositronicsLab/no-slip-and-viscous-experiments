# No-slip and viscous friction experiments

This repository describes experiments performed using the no-slip and purely
viscous friction methods described by (TBA).

The repository consists of two experiments:
* multi-block grasping (experiment #1)
* quadrupedal locomotion (experiment #2)

Necessary code and data for running the individual experiments can be found
in their respective sub-directories. 

## Installing software

**You can install _RPI-Sim_, _Moby_, and _Pacer_ from
scratch, but the code in the underlying subdirectories was used to
directly run the experiments. Using other versions may affect reproducibility.**
