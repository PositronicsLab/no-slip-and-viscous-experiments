# No-slip and viscous friction experiments

This repository describes experiments performed using the no-slip and purely
viscous friction methods described by (TBA).

The repository consists of two experiments:
* multi-block grasping (experiment #1)
* quadrupedal locomotion (experiment #2)

Necessary code and data for running the individual experiments can be found
in their respective sub-directories.
